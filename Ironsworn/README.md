# Ironsworn for Archipelago

*You stand, surrounded by your fellow townsfolk, bathed in the unearthly glow of the aurora. Bright as day in the midnight sky, the six rings of colored fire cast flickering shadows on the ground below. Some folk stare in wonder, others worry, but you know the truth. Your world is breaking. The strange howls of otherworldly monsters echo off the mountainsides, and the screams of terror confirm your fears. You must close the portal, or your world is doomed.*

## Intro

Ironsworn for Archipelago is a way to play a solo tabletop roleplaying game while integrated with the Archipelago multi-world randomizer.

Description of Archipelago from Archipelago.gg:
> This is a cross-game modification system which randomizes different games, then uses the result to build a single unified multi-player game. Items from one game may be present in another, and you will need your fellow players to find items you need in their games to help you complete your own.

Description of Ironsworn from IronswornRPG.com:
> In the Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying game, you are a hero sworn to undertake perilous quests in the dark fantasy setting of the Ironlands. Others live out their lives hardly venturing beyond the walls of their village or steading, but you are different. You will explore untracked wilds, fight desperate battles, forge bonds with isolated communities, and reveal the secrets of this harsh land.

This document provides additional rules, mechanisms, items, monsters, and dungeons for Ironsworn, while the content of this repository includes a `.apworld` file and `.yaml` file for integration with the Archipelago randomizer.

Playing through this content, you play as an adventurer in the Ironlands during the Fracturing. The veil between worlds is breaking, and you must locate the 10 Shards of Reality to close the portal. Unfortunately, those shards have been scattered throughout the multiverse! You'll need to find the scattered items and knowledge in your world, and in return you'll receive items and knowledge from beyond the aurora to aid in your quest.

In order to save your world, you must:
- Locate the 10 Shards of Reality
- Reforge them into the Reality Key
- Defeat the guardian of the Aurora, the Arch-demon Pelago

The tone of this module is more "gonzo" than a traditional Ironsworn campaign. You'll ally with Donald Duck who casts fireballs, learn swordplay from the hero of Hyrule, ride a Charizard into combat, and do battle with Mother Brain. The discordant nature of the content is intentional, and part of the fun is exploring how an iron age warrior would react to a Zergling, a pixellated diamond pickaxe, or a talking crocodile chef.

This content is designed to be used with Ironsworn, but could easily be adapted to work with any fantasy role-playing game you are more comfortable with. Modern, rules-light OSR games are easy to convert to, and Troika and Electric Bastionland are particularly well suited.

## Set Up

### Set Up Archipelago

This integration uses the Manual Archipelago tool available [here](https://discord.gg/CWcxqxf3zJ) to integrate with a multiworld. For additional information about how to set up an archipelago multiworld, refer to the instructions available at https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/.

The `.yaml` file has two possible options you can modify:

- `delve` allows you to toggle on or off the content from the Ironsworn Delve expansion
- `game_override` allows you to override the normal way the game decides which types of content to send you. Normally it will only send you materials from other games in the same multiworld, but you can choose to limit or expand that list based on your personal preference.

### Set Up Ironsworn

The campaign setup for this is a little different than the base game. Follow the steps below to get started:

#### 1. Create your world (page 194)
Establish the basic truths of your world using the tools provided (while keeping in mind the core conceit established above). 

#### 2. Create your character (page 193)
As part of the Archipelago setup, you will be given 3 random starting Assets. Use these assets to inform your character's name, identity and stat spread.

#### 3. Create your background bonds (page 195)
Create your bonds as normal.

#### 4. Create your background vow (page 195)
Your background vow is always "Close the Aurora", and is always Extreme rank. You can make progress toward this goal as normal, but receiving a Shard of Reality always counts as 2 ticks of progress. You do not need to *Swear an Iron Vow* for this quest.

#### 5. Receive your starting quest (page 199)
As part of the Archipelago setup, you will be given a random quest (quest text listed below). *Swear an Iron Vow* as usual to begin this quest.

#### 6. Set the scene and bein play (pages 198 and 200)
Based on the outcome of your *Swear an Iron Vow* move, envision how your character begins and play to see what happens next.

## During Play

### Archipelago Checks

The following in- and out-of-game actions count as checks for the Archipelago multiworld:

- **Spending Experience.** You don't spend XP in the normal way. Instead, you spend XP 1 for 1 to unlock Archipelago checks. There are 20 checks to unlock this way.
- **Forging Bonds.** Whenever you roll the *Forge a Bond* move, you unlock 1 check on a weak hit and 2 checks on a strong hit. This is in addition to the normal effects of the move. There are 10 checks to unlock this way.
- **Completing assigned quests.** Whenever you successfully *Fulfill your Vow* on one of the 6 assigned quests, you unlock (in order) each of the 6 "Quest" checks. You always unlock these checks in order, no matter what order you receive the quests and what order you complete the quests.
- **Reforging the Key.** There is a special check that occurs when you collect all 10 shards and reforge them into the Reality Key.

If you enable content from the Delve expansion in your YAML, you will also send checks for these actions:
- **Complete a Dungeon.** When you successfully *Locate your Objective* inside an assigned Delve site, you receive a check. You must receive the key to the site as an item from the multiworld before entering an assigned delve. There are 4 sites to unlock this way.
- **Find the Dungeon Secrets.** Inside each assigned Delve site, there is an opportunity to find a secret item. Once during each Delve, when you *Find an Opportunity* as a result of a strong hit while Delving, you may choose to locate the secret item instead of anything else on the result table. There are 4 secret locations to unlock this way.

### Archipelago Items

The following "items" can be sent to you through the Archipelago multiworld:

- **Shard of Reality:** 10 shards are scattered throughout the multiworld
- **Quests:** a total of 6 quests will be "assigned" to you through the multiworld. The main text of the quests are listed in [quests.md in the content folder.](./content/quests.md)
- **Assets:** You will be assigned 3 starting assets, and then sent 3 additional assets throughout the game. The assets you are sent will have some flavor text describing how they are granted by some game in the multiworld.
- **Asset Upgrades:** There are 6 asset upgrade items that allow you to unlock a new ability of an asset you have.
- **Traps:** There are 5 Trap items, that either describe a physical trap that your character must avoid, or describe a monster/creature that ambushes your character.
- **Useful Items:** You will receive 10 items of varying narrative usefulness.

If you enable content from the Delve expansion in your YAML, you will also recieve these items:
- **DELVE: Dungeon keys:** There are 4 dungeon keys shuffled into the item pool. The description for these dungeons is listed in [dungeons.md in the content folder.](./content/dungeons.md) Details for the pre-generated sites start on page 94 in the *Delve* rulebook.
- **DELVE: Relics:** There are 4 relics that can be sent to you. When you receive a relic, you choose an asset you have to assign the relic to.

## New Game Content

The randomizer has some custom game content, including new quest hooks and assets, and dungeons/denizens with the Delve expansion. Please see the [content folder](./content/).
